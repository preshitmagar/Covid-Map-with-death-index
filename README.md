# Covid-Map-with-death-index
A Website using Map API fetched from MapTiler. Displays covid cases on the map and updates them every 20000ms. If you click on a location it even shows the number of deaths which occurred there.

- Used html for the frontend
- used js to fetch MapTiler API from https://www.maptiler.com/
- used MapTiler Documentation to implement deaths popup.
- used data.json for covid data.
